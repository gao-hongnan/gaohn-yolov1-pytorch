    "# YOLOv1\n",
    "\n",
    "YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a single-stage object detector that frames object detection as a single\n",
    "regression problem to predict bounding box coordinates and class probabilities of objects in an image.\n",
    "The model is called YOLO because you only look once at an image to predict what objects are present \n",
    "and where they are in the image. \n",
    "There are several versions of YOLO models, with each one having a slightly different architecture \n",
    "from the others. In this article, we will focus on the very first model called YOLOv1. \n",
    "\n",
    "YOLOv1 comprises of a single convolutional neural network that simultaneously predicts \n",
    "multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities for these boxes. \n",
    "Compared to other traditional methods of object detection such as DPM and R-CNN,\n",
    "the YOLO model has several benefits such as being extremely fast,\n",
    "being able to reason globally about an image when making predictions and being able to learn\n",
    "generalizable representations of objects in an iamge. \n",
    " \n",
    "The YOLOv1 model uses an anchor-free architecture with parameterised bounding boxes. \n",
    "It takes in an RGB image (448×448×3) as its input and returns a tensor (7×7×30) as its output.\n",
    "The parameterisation of bounding boxes means that the the bounding box coordinates are defined \n",
    "relative to a particular grid in the 7×7 grid space (rather than being defined on an absolute scale).\n",
    "More information on the model architecture will be detailed in the Model Architecture section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unified Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "YOLOv1 is a unified detection model that simultaneously predicts multiple bounding boxes and class.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that given an input image $\\X$ of size $448\\times 448\\times 3$, the model network\n",
    "can accurately ***locate*** and ***classify*** multiple objects in the image with just one forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is in contrast to other object detection models such as R-CNN which require multiple forward passes\n",
    "since they use a two-stage pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is so smart about this architecture is that the author managed to design a network such that it can\n",
    "reason globally about the image when making predictions. The model's feature map is\n",
    "so powerful such that it can do both **regression (locate)** and **classification (classify)** at the same time. \n",
    "Regression being the task of predicting/localizing bounding box coordinates and \n",
    "classification being the task of predicting the class of the object in the bounding box.\n",
    "In the first version of YOLO, the model is treated as a regression problem, simply because the loss function\n",
    "is mean squared error, but in later versions\n",
    "of YOLO, the model is revised such that the loss function is a combination of regression and classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into more details, we define the model architecture first.\n",
    "\n",

    "simple architecture that resembles a image classification model. The authors also mentioned that\n",
    "the model was inspired by GoogLeNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are more interested in the last layer of the network, as that is where the novelty lies.\n",
    "{numref}`label-matrix` is a zoomed in version of the last layer, a cuboid of shape $7 \\times 7 \\times 30$.\n",

    "\n",
    "For each grid cell $i$, we a 30-d vector, 30 is derived from $5 \\times B + C$ elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "So each cell is responsible for predicting boxes from a single part of the image. More specifically, each cell is responsible for predicting precisely two boxes for each part of the image. Note that there are 49 cells, and each cell is predicting two boxes, so the whole network is only going to predict 98 boxes. That number is fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to predict a single box, the network must output a number of things. Firstly it must encode the coordinates of the box which YOLO encodes as (x, y, w, h), where x and y are the center of the box. Earlier I suggested you familiarise yourself with box parameterisation, this is because YOLO does not output the actual coordinates of the box, but parameterised coordinates instead. Firstly, the width and height are normalised with respect to the image width, so if the network outputs a value of 1.0 for the width, it's saying the box should span the entire image, likewise 0.5 means it's half the width of the image. Note that the width and height have nothing to do with the actual grid cell itself. The x and y values are parameterised with respect to the grid cell, they represent offsets from the grid cell position. The grid cell has a width and height which is equal to 1/S (we've normalised the image to have width and height 1.0). If the network outputs a value of 1.0 for x, then it's saying that the x value of the box is the x position of the grid cell plus the width of the grid cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, YOLO also predicts a confidence score for each box which represents the probability that the box contains an object. Lastly, YOLO predicts a class, which is represented by a vector of C values, and the predicted class is the one with the highest value. Now, here's the catch. YOLO does not predict a class for every box, it predicts a class for each cell. But each cell is associated with two boxes, so those boxes will have the same predicted class, even though they may have different shapes and positions. Let's tie all that together visually, let me copy down my diagram again.\n",
    "\n",

    "The output tensor from YOLOv1's last layer.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first five values encode the location and confidence of the first box, the next five encode the location and confidence of the next box, and the final 20 encode the 20 classes (because Pascal VOC has 20 classes). In total, the size of the vector is 5xB + C where B is the number of boxes, and C is the number of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way that YOLO actually predicts boxes, is by predicting target scale and offset values for each prior, these are parameterised by normalising by the width and height of the image. For example, take the highlighted top right cell in the output tensor, this particular cell corresponds to the far top right cell in the input image (which looks like the branch of a tree). That cell represents a prior box, which will have a width and height equal to the image width divided by 7 and image height divided by 7 respectively, and the location being the top right. The outputs from this single cell will therefore shift and stretch that prior box into new positions that hopefully contain the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the cell predicts two boxes, it will shift and stretch the prior box in two different ways, possibly to cover two different objects (but both are constrained to have the same class). You might wonder why it's trying to do two boxes. The answer is probably because 49 boxes isn't enough, especially when there are lots of objects close together, although what tends to happen during training is that the predicted boxes become specialised. So one box might learn to find big things, the other might learn to find small things, this may help the network generalise to other domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "To wrap this section up, I want to point out one difference between the approach that YOLO has taken, and the anchor boxes in the Region Proposal Network. Anchors in the RPN actually refer to the nine different aspect ratios and scales from a single location. In other words, each position in the RPN predicts nine different boxes from nine different prior widths and heights. In contrast, it's as if YOLO has two anchors at each position, but they have the same width and height. YOLO does not introduce variations in aspect ratio or size into the anchor boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note to help your intuition, it's reasonable to wonder why they didn't predict a class for each box. What would the output look like? You'd still have 7x7 cells, but instead of each cell being of size 5xB + C, you'd have (5+C) x B. So for two boxes, you'd have 50 outputs, not 30. That doesn't seem unreasonable, and it gives the network the flexibility to predict two different classes from the same location.\n",
